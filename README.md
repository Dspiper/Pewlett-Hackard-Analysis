# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

# Overview: 
The purpose of this analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. This will help managers prepare for the "silver tsunami" as employees reach retirement age.

- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees? Yes, there are enough retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees.
- Another table that would provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami" would be to see how many employees remain employees after they are eligible for retirement. 
- A helpful query would be to see how many employees would qualify for the mentorship program if the search was expanded to include employees born between 1962 and 1965.
